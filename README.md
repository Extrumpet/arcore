# Arduino hardware cores

This is a fork of the core Arduino core hardware libraries. Currently this
includes the [hardware/avr/core][1] and hardware/sam/core folders.

The goal is to have a simple base to customize the core libraries to add or modify core functionality, without
needing to clone the entire Arduino repository.

Version 1.5.x of the Arduino IDE is required to build projects with this library.

## Installation and Usage

Coming soon.
